Here's a collection of useful emoji (mostly formatted for Slack)

#### For Slack usage

Due to the addition of [dark mode](https://slackhq.com/dark-mode-for-slack-desktop)
- use transparent backgrounds

Be aware of the size of the content:
- busy images or small text can be difficult read (especially when used as reactions)
